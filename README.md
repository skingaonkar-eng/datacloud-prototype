# Project Untethered 🚀

An **Agentic Segmentation Workspace** that revolutionizes how marketers create and analyze audience segments. Move away from complex SQL queries and technical tables—just describe your goal, and let the AI Agent do the rest.

## The Vision

Traditional segmentation tools force marketers to understand databases, joins, and technical schemas. **Project Untethered** transforms this into a natural, visual, and intelligent experience where:

- 🎯 Goals are expressed in plain language
- 🤖 AI interprets and builds segmentation logic
- 🎨 Data flows as visual nodes, not rows and columns
- 📊 Real-time insights guide optimization
- ✨ The entire experience feels alive and intelligent

## 5-Step User Journey

### Step 1: Goal-Based Entry
Start with a simple goal: *"I want to win back high-value customers for our trek gear launch."*

The Agent interprets this to mean:
- High-value = LTV > $500
- Win back = No purchase in 6 months

### Step 2: Attribute Cards
Instead of complex filters, get visual **Attribute Cards**:
- 📈 Lifetime Value: Top 10%
- ⏰ Last Activity: 180+ Days
- 📦 Product Interest: Trekking Boots

Quick search to add more filters like "Region: Pacific Northwest"

### Step 3: Channel Affinity
See which channels work best for your audience:
- 📱 Mobile Push: 70% affinity (Top Pick!)
- 💬 SMS: 55% affinity
- ✉️ Email: 35% affinity

### Step 4: Agentic Splits
Let the AI suggest A/B test splits:
- **Group A**: 15% Discount via Mobile Push (6,244 people)
- **Group B**: Free Shipping via SMS (6,243 people)

Visual fork-in-the-road design shows the split clearly.

### Step 5: Analytics & Performance
Get comprehensive insights:
- 📊 **Segment Analytics**: Total reachable audience of 12,487
- 🔄 **Overlap Analysis**: Sleek Venn diagram showing audience intersections
- 🏆 **Performance**: Real-time A/B comparison with winner detection
